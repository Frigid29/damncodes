            <li>I  want to reset that garbage jujutsu world. Murdering everyone at the top would be an easy task. But they would just get replaced. It wouldn't bring a revolution. And if I did that, no one would follow me. That's why I chose education. To raise up strong, clever comrades.</li>

        <p>Satoru Gojo, reputed as The Strongest, is a major character in the manga miniseries Jujutsu Kaisen 0 (originally titled Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School) and its 2021 anime film adaptation of the same name, as well as the sequel anime/manga series Jujutsu Kaisen.
        He is the strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer in the world, even rivalling and surpassing the King of Curses Sukuna himself. Like most sorcerers, Satoru strived to protect the world from the Cursed Spirits that plagued it. However, Gojo saw the structure of Jujutsu Sorcerer society as flawed, and as such hoped to change it for the better. To this end, he became a teacher at Jujutsu High, a school dedicated to the cultivation of new generations of Jujutsu Sorcerers</p>
